        <h4>Artist by day, gaming degenerate by night</h4>
        <p>I'd like to think I'm passionate about art, although I'm not necessarily good at it. I spend a good hour or two sketching or creating digital paintings if the time is free. However,
          I'm far from the skill level that I aspire to be, but I do hope that micro improvements over the years will amount to something that I can be proud of one day. I mainly draw portraits. 
        </p>

        <p> <br> I also do a lot of gaming, especially compared to drawing. Perhaps I spend a solid 3-4 hours a day on gaming if I don't have anything important going on. I mostly play multiplayer games for 
          now like League of Legends and occasionally Valorant and Apex Legends. However, these games are far from my favorite games to play. Singplayer games are the most fun I usually have when gaming. My
          all time favorite would be Elden Ring, with Witcher 3 being a far second.
